Brunet P2P library

Building Brunet
================
Brunet uses the NAnt build tool.  To build all the code run NAnt in the
top level directory.  It will recursively build all the code.

If you are interested in building the Brunet.dll library, you can go
into the src/protocol directory and run NAnt.  The resulting library
will be placed in the lib/ directory.

On Debian/Ubuntu based systems, you'll need to install the following
packages:

nant mono mono-gmcs libmono-system-runtime2.0-cil

Tests
======
The tests/protocol directory has some simple interactive tests.  Some tests
have been created in the src/protocol directory as nunit tests.  You can
build an nunit testable Brunet.dll by going into src/protocol and building
the target "test", (command: nant test).

Example uses of Brunet
=========
For simple examples of writing an application which uses Brunet see
src/examples.

Brunet Chat
=========
There is a functional GTK# chat program in the src/apps/chat/ directory.
It should give a (somewhat unclean) example of using GTK#/Glade as well
as a non-trivial Brunet application.
