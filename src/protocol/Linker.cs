  /**
   *
   * Given a list of remote TransportAddress
   * objects, Linker creates the link between the remote node and
   * the local node
   *
   * There are several steps to linking:
   * 1) create an Edge for a TA (EdgeWorker)
   * 2) Start a LinkProtocolState (LPS) working on the Edge to get connected.
   * 3) At the completion of the LPS, we either, retry the TA, move to the
   * next, or give up.
   * 4) If we retry, we wait a time uniformly distributed over a fixed
   * interval.  After that period, we start again at the beginning.
   *
   * The code is designed to be able to handle several attempts in parallel so
   * nodes with many TAs can be connected to more quickly.
